# Betting Ace:-
This is basically a card game in which you have to pick one random card out of five.The cards are Joker,Ace,King ,Queen and Jack. You will start with a initial amount specified by you through a form. Then you will be prompted to bet some money (it should not be more than one-fifth of the total balance) and then start the game. There will be five cards with their faces down and you will have to select one at random. If you get an Ace you will win 5 times your bet money. For King and Queen there would be no change and you will be refunded the bet money. For Jack you will lose 3 times your bet money and for Joker you will lose 5 times your bet money.
You will be prompted each time after you complete one round to play more or not. If you want to play more you have set your bet money again via a dialog box. If you don't wish to play anymore the game will end then and there by clicking the cancel button. 
If you wan to win the game you have to last atleast 20 rounds.
After that you will get 3 times your initial amount as a small bonus.
